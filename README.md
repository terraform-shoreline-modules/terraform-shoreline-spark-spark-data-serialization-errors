### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark data serialization errors.
---

This incident type occurs when data serialization errors are encountered while processing certain types of data in Spark. Serialization errors can occur when trying to convert complex data structures or objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. These errors can cause failures in Spark jobs or tasks, leading to delays, errors, or other issues in the software system. It is important to identify and address these errors promptly to ensure the smooth functioning of the system.

### Parameters
```shell
export PATH_TO_SPARK_JOB_CONFIGURATION="PLACEHOLDER"

export DATA_THAT_CAUSED_SERIALIZATION_ERROR="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_DATA_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SPARK_LOGS="PLACEHOLDER"

export VERSION="PLACEHOLDER"

export LIBRARY="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Verify Spark installation and version
```shell
spark-submit --version
```

### Check Spark job configuration to ensure serializer is set correctly
```shell
grep -i "spark.serializer" ${PATH_TO_SPARK_JOB_CONFIGURATION}
```

### Inspect the data causing the serialization error
```shell
spark-shell

val data = ${DATA_THAT_CAUSED_SERIALIZATION_ERROR}

data.take(10)
```

### Check the encoding of the data to ensure it is compatible with the serializer
```shell
file -i ${PATH_TO_DATA_FILE}
```

### Check for any error messages in Spark logs related to data serialization errors
```shell
grep -i "serialization error" ${PATH_TO_SPARK_LOGS}
```

### Incompatibility between the Spark version and the data serialization library used.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set variables

SPARK_VERSION=${VERSION}

SERIALIZATION_LIBRARY=${LIBRARY}



# Check Spark version

if [[ "$SPARK_VERSION" != "2.4" ]]; then

  echo "Spark version $SPARK_VERSION is not compatible with this script."

  exit 1

fi



# Check serialization library

if [[ "$SERIALIZATION_LIBRARY" != "Kryo" ]]; then

  echo "Serialization library $SERIALIZATION_LIBRARY is not compatible with this script."

  exit 1

fi



# Check if data serialization errors are occurring

if grep -q "java.io.IOException: Failed to serialize" ${PATH_TO_SPARK_LOGS}; then

  echo "Data serialization errors are occurring."

else

  echo "No data serialization errors found."

fi


```

## Repair

### Upgrade spark version to the latest stable release.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the spark version to upgrade to

SPARK_VERSION=${VERSION}



# Download the latest stable release of spark

wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/spark/spark-$SPARK_VERSION/spark-$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz



# Extract the spark binaries to /opt/spark

sudo tar -xzf spark-$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.7.tgz -C /opt/



# Update the symbolic link to point to the new spark version

sudo ln -sf /opt/spark-$SPARK_VERSION-bin-hadoop2.7 /opt/spark



# Update the PATH variable to include the new spark binaries

echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/spark/bin' >> ~/.bashrc

source ~/.bashrc



# Verify the new spark version is installed and working

spark-submit --version


```
